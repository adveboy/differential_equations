--------------------------------------------------------
	- create library using matlab and c++ to solve differential equations and partial differential equations (can be shown in resume as well)
17th july:
	- implement euler method & backward euler method (matlab) (!!!finish anyway)
18th july:
	- finish and analyse euler method
	- runge-kutta
--------------------------------------------------------	
20th july:
	- general runge-kutta method (read through and implement in matlab first)
	- implicit runge-kutta method
--------------------------------------------------------
21th july:
	- solve partial differential equation using 2 different methods
--------------------------------------------------------
	so do everything to add a lot of buzzwords to CV:
		- C++, python, matlab, machine learning, partial differential equations,
		valuation methods, etc etc, trend following etc
	real skills to acquire: c++ in depth, matlab
	understand Ito formula and implement it in C++
--------------------------------------------------------
	understanding math method
	implementation of the math method
	matlab, python, c++
--------------------------------------------------------	
	* by 25th july master implementing the PDEs in the c++ code efficiently
--------------------------------------------------------	
	* stack task: build model for blackjack game
